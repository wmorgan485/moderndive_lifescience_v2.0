In Subsection \@ref(programming-concepts), we introduced the concept of a \index{data frame} data frame in R: a rectangular spreadsheet-like representation of data where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables describing each observation. In Chapter \@ref(viz), we created visualizations using data stored in a data frame, and in Chapter \@ref(wrangling), we learned how to take existing data frames and transform/modify them to suit our ends. 

In this final chapter of the "Data Science with `tidyverse`" portion of the book, we extend some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called "tidy" data. You will see that having data stored in "tidy" format is about more than just what the everyday definition of the term "tidy" might suggest: having your data "neatly organized." Instead, we define the term "tidy" as it's used by data scientists who use R, outlining a set of rules by which data is saved.

Knowledge of this type of data formatting was not necessary for our treatment of data visualization in Chapter \@ref(viz) and data wrangling in Chapter \@ref(wrangling). This is because all the data used were already in "tidy" format. In this chapter, we'll now see that this format is essential to using the tools we covered up until now. Furthermore, it will also be useful for all subsequent chapters in this book when we cover statistical inference and regression.

library(scales)
```




## "Tidy" data {#tidy-data-ex}
We will learn about the concept of "tidy" data with a motivating example from the `fivethirtyeight` package. The `fivethirtyeight` package [@R-fivethirtyeight] provides access to the datasets used in many articles published by the data journalism website, [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). For a complete list of all `r nrow(data(package = "fivethirtyeight")[[3]])` datasets included in the `fivethirtyeight` package, check out the package webpage by going to: <https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/articles/fivethirtyeight.html>.\index{R packages!fivethirtyeight}

Let's focus our attention on the `drinks` data frame and look at its first 5 rows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
drinks %>%
  head(5)
```

After reading the help file by running `?drinks`, you'll see that `drinks` is a data frame containing results from a survey of the average number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed in `r drinks %>% nrow()` countries. This data was originally reported on FiveThirtyEight.com in Mona Chalabi's article: ["Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/).

Let's apply some of the data wrangling verbs we learned in Chapter \@ref(wrangling) on the `drinks` data frame:

1. `filter()` the `drinks` data frame to only consider 4 countries: the United States, China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, *then*
1. `select()` all columns except `total_litres_of_pure_alcohol` by using the `-` sign, *then*
1. `rename()` the variables `beer_servings`, `spirit_servings`, and `wine_servings` to `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`, respectively.

and save the resulting data frame in `drinks_smaller`:

```{r}
drinks_smaller <- drinks %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("USA", "China", "Italy", "Saudi Arabia")) %>% 
  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) %>% 
  rename(beer = beer_servings, spirit = spirit_servings, wine = wine_servings)
drinks_smaller
```

Let's now ask ourselves a question: "Using the `drinks_smaller` data frame, how would we create the side-by-side barplot in Figure \@ref(fig:drinks-smaller)?". Recall we saw barplots displaying two categorical variables in Subsection \@ref(two-categ-barplot).

```{r drinks-smaller, fig.cap="Comparing alcohol consumption in 4 countries.", fig.height=3.9, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
drinks_smaller_tidy <- drinks_smaller %>%
  gather(type, servings, -country)
drinks_smaller_tidy_plot <- ggplot(
  drinks_smaller_tidy,
  aes(x = country, y = servings, fill = type)
) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "country", y = "servings")
if (is_html_output()) {
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot
} else {
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot + scale_fill_grey()
}
```

Let's break down the grammar of graphics we introduced in Section \@ref(grammarofgraphics):

1. The categorical variable `country` with four levels (China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, USA) would have to be mapped to the `x`-position of the bars.
1. The numerical variable `servings` would have to be mapped to the `y`-position of the bars (the height of the bars).
1. The categorical variable `type` with three levels (beer, spirit, wine) would have to be mapped to the `fill` color of the bars.

Observe that `drinks_smaller` has three separate variables `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`.  In order to use the `ggplot()` function to recreate the barplot in Figure \@ref(fig:drinks-smaller) however, we need a *single variable* `type` with three possible values: `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`.  We could then map this `type` variable to the `fill` aesthetic of our plot.  In other words, to recreate the barplot in Figure \@ref(fig:drinks-smaller), our data frame would have to look like this:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This redundant code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
n_row_drinks <- drinks_smaller_tidy %>% nrow()
n_alcohol_types <- drinks_smaller_tidy %>%
  select(type) %>%
  n_distinct()
n_countries <- drinks_smaller_tidy %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()
```

Observe that while `drinks_smaller` and `drinks_smaller_tidy` are both rectangular in shape and contain the same `r n_row_drinks` numerical values (`r n_alcohol_types` alcohol types by `r n_countries` countries), they are formatted differently. `drinks_smaller` is formatted in what's known as \index{wide data format} ["wide"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) format, whereas `drinks_smaller_tidy` is formatted in what's known as ["long/narrow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data#Narrow) format.

In the context of doing data science in R, long/narrow format \index{long data format} is also known as "tidy" format. In order to use the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages for data visualization and data wrangling, your input data frames *must* be in "tidy" format. Thus, all non-"tidy" data must be converted to "tidy" format first. Before we convert non-"tidy" data frames like `drinks_smaller` to "tidy" data frames like `drinks_smaller_tidy`, let's define "tidy" data.


### Definition of "tidy" data {#tidy-definition}

You have surely heard the word "tidy" in your life:

* "Tidy up your room!"
* "Write your homework in a tidy way so it is easier to provide feedback."
* Marie Kondo's best-selling book, [_The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing_](https://www.powells.com/book/-9781607747307), and Netflix TV series [_Tidying Up with Marie Kondo_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80209379).
* "I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - 'Read me, please!'" - Linda Grant

What does it mean for your data to be "tidy"? While "tidy" has a clear English meaning of "organized," the word "tidy" in data science using R means that your data follows a standardized format. We will follow Hadley Wickham's \index{Wickham, Hadley} definition of *"tidy" data* \index{tidy data} [@tidy] shown also in Figure \@ref(fig:tidyfig):

> A *dataset* is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings AKA text data (if qualitative/categorical). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes.
> 
> "Tidy" data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In *tidy data*:
>
> 1. Each variable forms a column.
> 2. Each observation forms a row.
> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

(ref:tidy-r4ds) Tidy data graphic from *R for Data Science*.

```{r tidyfig, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:tidy-r4ds)", out.height="80%", out.width="80%", purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("images/r4ds/tidy-1.png")
```

For example, say you have the following table of chick weights (in g) in Table \@ref(tab:non-tidy-stocks):

```{r non-tidy-stocks, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
stocks <- tibble(
  Date = as.Date("2009-01-01") + 0:4,
  `Chick 1 weight` = paste(c("173.55", "172.61", "173.86", "170.77", "174.29"),"g", sep = " "),
  `Chick 2 weight` = paste(c("174.90", "171.42", "171.58", "173.89", "170.16"),"g", sep = " "),
  `Chick 3 weight` = paste(c("174.34", "170.04", "173.65", "174.87", "172.19"), "g", sep = " ")
) %>%
  slice(1:2)
stocks %>%
  kable(
    digits = 2,
    caption = "Chick weights (non-tidy format)",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
```

Although the data are neatly organized in a rectangular spreadsheet-type format, they do not follow the definition of data in "tidy" format. While there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (date, chick ID, and weight), there are not three columns. In "tidy" data format, each variable should be its own column, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:tidy-stocks). Notice that both tables present the same information, but in different formats. 

```{r tidy-stocks, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
stocks_tidy <- stocks %>%
  rename(
    `1` = `Chick 1 weight`,
    `2` = `Chick 2 weight`,
    `3` = `Chick 3 weight`,
  ) %>%
  #  gather(`Stock name`, `Stock price`, -Date)
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Date,
    names_to = "Chick ID",
    values_to = "Weight"
  )
stocks_tidy %>%
  kable(
    digits = 2,
    caption = "Chick weights (tidy format)",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
```

Now we have the requisite three columns Date, Chick ID, and Weight. On the other hand, consider the data in Table \@ref(tab:tidy-stocks-2).

```{r tidy-stocks-2, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
stocks <- tibble(
  Date = as.Date("2009-01-01") + 0:4,
  `Chick 1 weight` = paste(c("173.55", "172.61", "173.86", "170.77", "174.29"),"g", sep = " "),
  `Weather` = c("Sunny", "Overcast", "Rain", "Rain", "Sunny")
) %>%
  slice(1:2)
stocks %>%
  kable(
    digits = 2,
    caption = "Example of tidy data" # ,
    #    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
```

In this case, even though the variable "Chick 1 weight" occurs just like in our non-"tidy" data in Table \@ref(tab:non-tidy-stocks), the data *is* "tidy" since there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information: Date, Chick 1 weight, and the Weather that particular day.

### Converting to "tidy" data

In this book so far, you've only seen data frames that were already in "tidy" format. Furthermore, for the rest of this book, you'll mostly only see data frames that are already in "tidy" format as well. This is not always the case however with all datasets in the world. If your original data frame is in wide (non-"tidy") format and you would like to use the `ggplot2` or `dplyr` packages, you will first have to convert it to "tidy" format. To do so, we recommend using the \index{tidyr!pivot\_longer()} `pivot_longer()` function in the `tidyr` \index{R packages!tidyr} package [@R-tidyr]. 

Going back to our `drinks_smaller` data frame from earlier:

```{r}
drinks_smaller
```

We convert it to "tidy" format by using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package as follows:

```{r}
drinks_smaller_tidy <- drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = -country)
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

We set the arguments to `pivot_longer()` as follows:

1. `names_to` here corresponds to the name of the variable in the new "tidy"/long data frame that will contain the *column names* of the original data. Observe how we set `names_to = "type"`. In the resulting `drinks_smaller_tidy`, the column `type` contains the three types of alcohol `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`. Since `type` is a variable name that doesn't appear in `drinks_smaller`, we use quotation marks around it. You'll receive an error if you just use `names_to = type` here.
1. `values_to` here is the name of the variable in the new "tidy" data frame that will contain the *values* of the original data. Observe how we set `values_to = "servings"` since each of the numeric values in each of the `beer`, `wine`, and `spirit` columns of the `drinks_smaller` data corresponds to a value of `servings`. In the resulting `drinks_smaller_tidy`, the column `servings` contains the `r n_countries` $\times$ `r n_alcohol_types` = `r n_row_drinks` numerical values. Note again that `servings` doesn't appear as a variable in `drinks_smaller` so it again needs quotation marks around it for the `values_to` argument.
1. The third argument `cols` is the columns in the `drinks_smaller` data frame you either want to or don't want to "tidy." Observe how we set this to `-country` indicating that we don't want to "tidy" the `country` variable in `drinks_smaller` and rather only `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`. Since `country` is a column that appears in `drinks_smaller` we don't put quotation marks around it.

The third argument here of `cols` is a little nuanced, so let's consider code that's written slightly differently but that produces the same output: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = c(beer, spirit, wine))
```

Note that the third argument now specifies which columns we want to "tidy" with `c(beer, spirit, wine)`, instead of the columns we don't want to "tidy" using `-country`. We use the `c()` function to create a vector of the columns in `drinks_smaller` that we'd like to "tidy." Note that since these three columns appear one after another in the `drinks_smaller` data frame, we could also do the following for the `cols` argument:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = beer:wine)
```

With our `drinks_smaller_tidy` "tidy" formatted data frame, we can now produce the barplot you saw in Figure  \@ref(fig:drinks-smaller) using `geom_col()`. This is done in Figure \@ref(fig:drinks-smaller-tidy-barplot). Recall from Section \@ref(geombar) on barplots that we use `geom_col()` and not `geom_bar()`, since we would like to map the "pre-counted" `servings` variable to the `y`-aesthetic of the bars.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(drinks_smaller_tidy, aes(x = country, y = servings, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

(ref:drinks-col) Comparing alcohol consumption in `r n_countries` countries using geom_col().

```{r drinks-smaller-tidy-barplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:drinks-col)", fig.height=2.5, purl=FALSE}
if (is_html_output()) {
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot
} else {
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot + scale_fill_grey()
}
```

Converting "wide" format data to "tidy" format often confuses new R users. The only way to learn to get comfortable with the `pivot_longer()` function is with practice, practice, and more practice using different datasets. For example, run `?pivot_longer` and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file. We'll show another example of using `pivot_longer()` to convert a "wide" formatted data frame to "tidy" format in Section \@ref(case-study-tidy). 

If however you want to convert a "tidy" data frame to "wide" format, you will need to use the `pivot_wider()`\index{tidyr!pivot\_wider()} function instead. Run `?pivot_wider` and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file for examples.

You can also view examples of both `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` on the [tidyverse.org](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html#pew) webpage. There's a nice example to check out the different functions available for data tidying and a case study using data from the World Health Organization on that webpage. Furthermore, each week the R4DS Online Learning Community posts a dataset in the weekly [`#`TidyTuesday event](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) that might serve as a nice place for you to find other data to explore and transform. 

```{block, type="learncheck", purl=FALSE}
\vspace{-0.15in}

\vspace{-0.1in}
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Take a look again at the `blackbird` data frame that you previously imported in Subsection \@ref(using-the-console). Run the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
blackbird <- read_csv("https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/Data/chapter12/chap12e2BlackbirdTestosterone.csv")
blackbird
```

As mentioned earlier, `blackbird` is a data frame containing information that compares the immunocompetence of red-winged blackbirds before and after testosterone implants. For simplicity, let's remove the last two columns, which are the log-transformed values of the data in the previous two columns:

```{r}
blackbird_smaller <- blackbird %>% 
  select(!starts_with("log"))
blackbird_smaller
```

This data frame is not in "tidy" format. How would you convert this data frame to be in "tidy" format, so that it has a variable `Time_Period` indicating the time period (before or after implant) and a variable `Measurement` of the immunocompetence level?

```{block, type="learncheck", purl=FALSE}
\vspace{-0.25in}

```




## Case study: Weight loss data {#case-study-tidy}

In this section, we'll show you another example of how to convert a data frame that isn't in "tidy" format ("wide" format) to a data frame that is in "tidy" format ("long/narrow" format). We'll do this using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package again. 

Then, we'll make use of functions from the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages to produce a *time-series plot* showing weight loss data for three groups of individuals: control, diet, and diet plus exercise. Recall that we saw time-series plots in Section \@ref(linegraphs) on creating linegraphs using `geom_line()`. 

We'll summarize the `WeightLoss` data frame available in the `carData` package and focus on average weight loss data for the Diet + Exercise group. 

```{r}
WeeklyAverage <- WeightLoss %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_wl1 = mean(wl1), 
            mean_wl2 = mean(wl2), 
            mean_wl3 = mean(wl3))
WeeklyAverage
```

Now, let's lay out the grammar of graphics we saw in Section \@ref(grammarofgraphics). 

First we know we need to set `data = WeeklyAverage` and use a `geom_line()` layer, but what is the aesthetic mapping of variables? We'd like to see how the weight loss has changed over the months for each group, so we need to map:

* `month` to the x-position aesthetic,
* `weightloss` to the y-position aesthetic, and
* `group` to the color aesthetic.

Now we are stuck in a predicament, much like with our `drinks_smaller` example in Section \@ref(tidy-data-ex). We have a variable/column named `group`, but the other variables/columns have combined information about *both* the month and the average weight loss. Because the `WeeklyAverage` data frame is not "tidy", we cannot use the `ggplot2` package until the data is in the appropriate format to apply the grammar of graphics.  

So how do we convert this data frame into a tidy format. First, we need to take the numeric values from the `mean_wl` column names in `WeeklyAverage` and place them into a new "names" variable called `month`. Then, we need to take the average weight loss values inside  the data frame and turn them into a new "values" variable called `weightloss`. Our resulting data frame will have three columns:  `group`, `month`, and `weightloss`. Recall that the `pivot_longer()` function in the `tidyr` package does this for us:

```{r}
WeeklyAverage_tidy <- WeeklyAverage %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -group,
               names_to = "month", 
               values_to = "weightloss") 
WeeklyAverage_tidy
```

1. The first argument specifies the columns you either want to or don't want to "tidy." We set this to `cols = -group` indicating that we don't want to "tidy" the `group` variable but do want to "tidy" the other variables in `WeeklyAverage`. 
1. `names_to` is the name of the variable in the new "tidy" data frame that will contain the *column names* of the original data. Observe how we set `names_to = "month"`.  In the resulting `WeeklyAverage_tidy`, the column `month` indicates the month (1, 2, or 3) that the weight loss was measured.
1. `values_to` is the name of the variable in the new "tidy" data frame that will contain the *values* of the original data. Observe how we set `values_to = "weightloss"`. In the resulting `WeeklyAverage_tidy` data frame, the column `weightloss` contains the 3 $\times$ 3 = 9 weight loss scores as numeric values.

This is a good start, but to create the time-series plot, the month variable needs to be numeric, not a character string. We can fix this by converting the `month` variable to an integer using two additional arguments in the `pivot_longer` command. We'll use `names_prefix` to strip off the `mean_wl` prefix from each column name, and `names_transform` to convert `month` into an integer variable. 

```{r}
WeeklyAverage_tidy <- WeeklyAverage %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -group,
               names_to = "month",
               names_prefix = "mean_wl",
               names_transform = list(month = as.integer),
               values_to = "weightloss") 
WeeklyAverage_tidy
```

We can now create the time-series plot in Figure \@ref(fig:guat-dem-tidy) using \index{ggplot2!geom\_line()} `geom_line()` to visualize how weight loss scores in each group changed during the study. Furthermore, we'll use the `labs()` function in the `ggplot2` package to add informative labels to the `aes()`thetic attributes of our plot.

```{r guat-dem-tidy, fig.cap="Weight loss scores of control group.", fig.height=3}
ggplot(WeeklyAverage_tidy, aes(x = month, y = weightloss, color = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Weight Loss Score", color = "Study group")
```

We see that the Diet + Exercise (DietEx) group had a higher average weight loss score in the first month than the other groups, but eventually the average weight loss scores converged in the third month.

Note that if we forgot to include the `names_transform` argument specifying that `month` should be in the integer format, we would have gotten an error here since `geom_line()` wouldn't have known how to sort the character values in `month` in the right order.

## `tidyverse` package {#tidyverse-package}

Notice at the beginning of the chapter we loaded the following four packages, which are among four of the most frequently used R packages for data science:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```

Recall that `ggplot2` is for data visualization, `dplyr` is for data wrangling, `readr` is for importing spreadsheet data into R, and `tidyr` is for converting data to "tidy" format. There is a much quicker way to load these packages than by individually loading them: by installing and loading the `tidyverse` package. The `tidyverse` package acts as an "umbrella" package whereby installing/loading it will install/load multiple packages at once for you. 

After installing the `tidyverse` package as you would a normal package as seen in Section \@ref(packages), running:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

would be the same as running:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
```

The `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats` are left for a more advanced book; check out [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) to learn about these packages.

For the remainder of this book, we'll start every chapter by running `library(tidyverse)`, instead of loading the various component packages individually. The `tidyverse` "umbrella" package gets its name from the fact that all the functions in all its packages are designed to have common inputs and outputs: data frames are in "tidy" format. This standardization of input and output data frames makes transitions between different functions in the different packages as seamless as possible. For more information, check out the [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/) webpage for the package.

If you want to learn more about using the `readr` and `tidyr` package, we suggest that you check out RStudio's cheat sheets. In the current version of RStudio, you can access these by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -> Help -> Cheat Sheets -> "Browse Cheatsheets...". on Cheatsheets web page, scroll down the page to find the cheatsheets for `readr` and `tidyr`. 

### What's to come?

Congratulations! You've completed the "Data Science with `tidyverse`" portion of this book. We'll now move to the "Statistical Inference with `infer`" portion of this book. Statistical inference is the science of inferring about some unknown quantity using sampling.

The most well-known examples of sampling in practice involve *polls*. Because asking an entire population about their opinions would be a long and arduous task, pollsters often take a smaller sample that is hopefully representative of the population. Based on the results of this sample, pollsters hope to make claims about the entire population. 

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:part2), once we've covered Chapter \@ref(sampling) on sampling, we'll examine confidence intervals in Chapter \@ref(confidence-intervals) and hypothesis testing in Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing).
